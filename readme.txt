Instructions on how to use this simulation tool.

Load the entire folder + subfolders into MATLAB.

Run the latest scriptxx.m file. 

There are parameters in the first 'section' of the script (and also 'flags' in a later section of the script to display different graphics such as cycling input power or height).
These parameters can be changed to your will. Default parameters are already inserted. The parameters should be self-explanatory.

Simulation tool created by Samad Arshad for the fourth year undergraduate project in engineering. Supervised by Dr Geoff Parks and Prof. Tony Purnell.
