%finding width of track

%could take two cursor points on track surface and do this 
norm(cursor_info1(1).Position - cursor_info1(2).Position)
%to give  6.7126, 7.2284,  7.4744,7.1705,  7.1897,  6.6559
%therefore assumed track width is 7m, except along one length which its
%6.65m
%lets take lanes equivalent to cyclist typical spacing?
